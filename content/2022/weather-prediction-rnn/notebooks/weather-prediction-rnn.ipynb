Since we are trying to predict what the next value is with our rainfall model, we'll want to give the model what the previous rainfall values were. We do this by creating new columns called 'time lags' where it takes the value from n points in past and this becomes a feature. For example, if we were to look at the `lag7` column, that would contain the recorded rainfall a week prior to the selected data point.\n",
