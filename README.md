### Hi there 👋, I am Jack McKew!
###### *Engineer | Software Developer | Data Scientist*

I'm an engineer from Newcastle Australia, very passionate about open source software and data science. Always looking for new ideas to try and develop!

Welcome to the source code repository for my blog [jackmckew.dev](https://jackmckew.dev).

The blog is generated from the main branch of this repository, there's a Github Action (formerly TravisCI), that on push:

1. Pulls the latest version of the repository
2. Sets up Python
3. Installs any necessary dependencies
4. Formats all code with [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
5. Generates the site (as static HTML) with [pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/)
6. Pushes the built site to the `gh-pages` branch
7. Netlify sees the change, and puts the site on [jackmckew.dev](https://jackmckew.dev)
